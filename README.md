<h3 align='center'><em>A web app that focuses on building quick and easy promotion for local businesses affected by the pandemic.</em></h3>

##  why?
COVID-19. The global pandemic that some may be lucky enough to have grown accustomed to... but for some, it has impacted their income, their way of life. We might notice superpowers, such as Walmart, Costco, etc., are the main source of food and goods for the general population, but smaller, more local businesses have been forced to suffer during lock downs. The goal of our web app, **bloom.**, is to allow anyone to browse through local services as well as their information that various business owners can provide.
